==========================================
==             INTRODUCTION             ==
==========================================

Mouse Quest is a top-down shoot-em-up ("smhup" for short), in the style of
video games from the 1980's and 1990's.

You control Mike, a sentient computer mouse who's out to save the world
from a virus-infected fleet of computer hardware. Fight the humble floppy
disk and CD-ROM, all the way to perhipherals of immense size and ferocity.


==========================================
==            HOW TO PLAY               ==
==========================================

Start the game by pressing SPACE.

To control Mike, use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and press SPACE to
shoot your laser. You can hold down SPACE to give your enemies a taste of 
your rapid fire mode, too!

To exit the game, press ESCAPE from the title screen. Or press ESCAPE twice 
if you're in the middle of a level.
