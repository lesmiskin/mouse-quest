# Rows of destruction.
# Tempo.
# Moving around the screen.
# Challenge is in getting all the waves.
# Ballet of queued-up homing shots.

# Shots to animate.
# Big explosion and continue screen.

# IDEA: Angular enemies that can be destroyed in rows.
# IDEA: Enemies that come together in a combined row.

# Spawn weapons as own dropdowns.
# Default weapon: Two shots that have light strength.
# Weapon 2: Four shots (red)
# Weapon 3: Six shots (green) plus two at angles.

# Generator:
# Idea of meta-patterns: You'll always get two or three normal patterns, and one fullscreen pattern.
# Idea of themes within levels. First is sparse, second is medium, third is really busy.
# 2 - 4 second pause between waves.
# 50 waves. (LOVE how I can just crank this up).

# WHAT IS FUN TO PLAY:
#     - ROWS OF ENEMIES IN COLUMNS.
#     - BIG LONG SNAKES OF ENEMIES.
#     - GOOD, UPBEAT TIMING BETWEEN COLUMNS.
#     - REQUIRING THE PLAYER TO MOVE AROUND A LOT.
#     - BEING ABLE TO HIT ROWS OF ENEMIES IN ONE GO.
#
# # WHAT IS VISUALLY EFFECTIVE:
#     - COMPLEX AND INTERESTING PATTERNS (E.G. MAG_SPLIT)
#     - DELTAS WITH FAST/SLOW ENDS TO THEM.
#     - SWINGING SPACE-INVADER ROWS.
#
# # WHAT IS CLEVER BUT NOT ANNOYING:
#     - CHANGING UP PREVIOUSLY-ESTABLISHED PATTERNS.
#     - ADDING SHOOTERS TO AVOID SITTING IN ONE SPOT.
#
#
#
# # WHAT IS NOT FUN TO PLAY:
#     - SINING STRAFERS THAT SHOOT.
#     - SHOTS THAT ARE WAY TOO FAST TO DODGE.

# L: Down screen all the way, then angles up (sine) completely offscreen.
# R: Down screen all the way, then angles up (sine) completely offscreen.
# L: Column down the screen, then angles up (sine) completely offscreen.

# Fast-moving dropper, shoots two shots at a time.
# Three slow-moving droppers, in tri configuration, only first one shoots two shots fast.

# A row of deltas, traveling medium speed down the screen. [need v. light health]

# Interlaced L and R strafers, sining offscreen, medium-speed shooting rate.

# Two columns of CDs with sining floppies next to them.
# Another set of strafers follows in behind, overlapping the second CD row.

## Dramatic pause.

# Two fast columns of CDs come in
