Windows version 0.13

==========================================
==           INTRODUCTION               ==
==========================================

Mouse Quest is a top-down shoot-em-up ("shmup" for short), in the style of
video games from the 1980's and 1990's.

You control Mike, a sentient computer mouse who's out to save the world
from a virus-infected fleet of computer hardware. Fight the humble floppy
disk and CD-ROM, all the way to peripherals of immense size and ferocity.

This version of Mouse Quest is a small preview only, and includes just one 
level and limited game features. The quality of the full game may change 
dramatically upon release, so please keep this in mind while playing.

If you have any comments or feedback on Mouse Quest, please contact Les
Miskin on <trilinear.nz@gmail.com>.


==========================================
==            INSTALLATION              ==
==========================================

1. Extract the Mouse Quest compressed file to a folder of your choosing.
2. Double-click on "mouse-quest.exe".
3. If you receive a notification from Windows Smartscreen stating that Mouse 
   Quest is an unrecognised program, click the More Info link.
4. Click the Run Anyway button. Mouse Quest will start, and you won't 
   receive this prompt again.

Remember you can make a shortcut to 'mouse-quest.exe' and put it on your
desktop for easy access. You know you want to!


==========================================
==            HOW TO PLAY               ==
==========================================

Start the game by pressing SPACE.

To control Mike, use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and press SPACE to
shoot your laser. You can hold down SPACE to give your enemies a taste of 
your rapid fire mode, too!

To exit the game, press ESCAPE from the title screen. Or press ESCAPE twice 
if you're in the middle of a level.
